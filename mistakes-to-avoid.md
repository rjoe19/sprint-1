summary of notes:

1)Bad Search:
- overally literal search engines.
-prioritising results based on number of query terms, rather then document relevance.

2)PDF Files for Online Reading
- its slow, breaks readers flow and isn't optimised for browser viewing.

3) Not Changing the Color of Visited Links
-changing the colour is essential in helping the user with flow of navigation, where their journey has/is going on the web.
- changing the colour can mitigate page revisits and user navigational disorientation.

4) Non-Scannable Text
- i.e. write for online, not print.
- utilise good practise to improve usability, such as subheads, bulleted lists etc.

5) Fixed Font Size
- CSS allows the change font size button to be disabled (95% of the time, fixed font sizes are tiny and reduces readability for users of 40.)
- Let the user resize text; allow font to be shown in relative terms.

6. Page Titles With Low Search Engine Visibility
- Search is the primary method of users finding websites.
- title is main way for users to locate specific pages.
- contained within HTML <title> tag
- used as default entry to favourites when bookmarking a page, so be careful with starting with "the" for instance.
- for pages other then homepage, use keywords pertinent to what the page is about.

7. Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement
- Be aware of "selective attention" - anything that looks like an add will be automatically avoided.
-follow these rules:
      - banner blindness
      - animation avoidance
      - pop-up purges
