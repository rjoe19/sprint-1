reflections re emotional empathy



1) search inside yourself - chapter 1

- definitely agree that emotional intelligence is a better determinant of success/progress in the workforce as well as in one's personal life because life consists of interacting with others in some way or another.
- I have known about the concept of emotional intelligence for some time know, but never really formally trained myself to do it, oh well, I think I'll start since it's part of this dev academy curriculum.
- I know from other's experiences with meditation that they report thinking clearer about things, being more calm etc - I've tried meditation and keep getting distracted - it's not easy to think about 'nothing'.  I have this app called meditations made by Mindvalley on my iphone and it's got a 10 min 'good morning meditation' app on there so I have been using that recently, I will be more consistent with it.




2) meet your inner critic
- I think we can be our own worst enemy.
- Even during weekone I was freaking out with installation issues thinking I was stupid for not understanding git hub.
- Ditto with coding.  I know coding isn't easy, but when I've done exercise on code academy and just stared blankly at the screen when stumped on a problem, the self doubt, inner critic can come out and I feel myself having to "cheat" by going on the forums and copying other ppls code etc and feel silly or inadequate doing that (even thats part of the learning process)
- This inner critic pervaids in other areas of life, usually when I'm learning a new concept/task for the first time that is either complex or takes me out of my comfort zone.  When it comes to making mistakes I realise that hindsight is easy and it's easy to say I should have done this or said that, and I've been told I'm hard on myself by others, but I guess making mistakes and iterating on that process 'failing forward' towards the goal is a better mindset to have in life (it is that society in general reinforces the notion that mistakes should be avoided at all costs etc so that doesn't help!)






3) Learn about privelage
-my understanding re this video is that those who are ahead or progressing faster in this course then others should give a helping hand to the ones below them.  In a sense this ethos goes against the way we're brought in society that its a dog eat dog world, that we should be selfish, that if i help other people I wont be getting ahead myself and getting a competitive advantage.
  -further to the paragraph above, yes logically it makes sense that by working together we can achieve a better outcome (according to Game theory) - but this is so hard to do psychologically I guess.

-In saying that I'm keen at least for the purposes of this course, to help others in my kakapo group et al, (within reason) as best as I can, because coding is not easy done alone and I know I'll fail trying alone (otherwise I wouldn't bother enrolling in this course).  Also we're social creatures, and I think even if you think you're an introvert nerd, you still long to have social input and interaction which is irreplaceable.
